A brief overview of what the purpose of this project is
Description of technologies used to create this project
How I think this project could be improved

Intro This project is called "Around The U.S." This is a website for explorers to post photos from their adventures.


Technologies Utilized 

In this project I utilized the following technologies:

VSCODE: I prefer to utilize for coding
HTML: Used to create the basic structure of the webpage and organized via BEM style
CSS: Used to define the specific styles for the webpage and also to make the webpage responsive for the webpage to function according to the user's device.
Github: To deploy my code and store the working and completed project from VScode
Figma: Provided an overview of the webpage design and the specifications needed for this project
Ideas For Improvement I think this project could best be improved by adding a feature for users to customize the way their profile looks therefore creating more individuality and also creating a design for this webpage that is more fitting for what the purpose. It's about social connection between outdoor adventures and the design right now is very black, industrial, and unwelcoming to use. I would improve this by putting thought into the design of the webpage based on it's purpose and the types of users it's trying to appeal to.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
